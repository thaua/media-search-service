## Description

This application is responsible for searching into media providers (such as YouTube, Spotify, etc) based on query string.

This is a part of a bigger private project.

## Requirements

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)

## Development

We are using Docker with the [scripts-to-rule-them-all](https://github.com/github/scripts-to-rule-them-all) idea, so we have a set of scripts inside `script` folder that should cover all development needs:

```bash
$ script/setup    # builds application
$ script/server   # runs application
$ script/update   # keeps application up to date
$ script/test     # run tests of the application
$ script/lint     # runs lint tool on application
$ script/bash     # access bash into container
```

## Technical Details

- Backend Framework: `ExpressJS`;
- Architecture: `Backend Application - Clean Architecture - REST API`;
- Methodologies, principles and practices: `Test-Driven Development (TDD) - Clean Code - SOLID - YAGNI - KISS`.
